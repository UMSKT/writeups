# UMSKT Writeup Repository

Greetings all. This repository is where you will find our documentation on the inner workings activation mechanisms. 

Currently, we have written documentation on the following topics:

- [Windows XP Confirmation IDs](./ConfID.md)
- [PKEY2005 (Windows Vista/7) Product Key Validation](./PIDGENX.md)

We do assume the reader has certain background knowledge in mathematics and programming when creating these writeups, but much of this background info is readily available on the internet.

Some suggested reading for those looking to use, understand, or contribute to our documentation:

- [Wikipedia - Finite field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field)
- [Wikipedia - Finite field arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic)
- [David Forney - Introduction to finite fields](http://web.stanford.edu/~marykw/classes/CS250_W18/readings/Forney_Introduction_to_Finite_Fields.pdf)
- [Nick Sullivan - A (Relatively Easy To Understand) Primer on Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/)
- [Wikipedia - Elliptic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve)
- [Wikipedia - Elliptic-curve cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography)
- [Wikipedia - Imaginary hyperelliptic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_hyperelliptic_curve)
- [Wikipedia - Hyperelliptic curve cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperelliptic_curve_cryptography)
- [Craig Costello - Pairings for Beginners](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fdbb09f31d71c1227082339/t/5ff394720493bd28278889c6/1609798774687/PairingsForBeginners.pdf)

We take care to ensure that our documentation is accurate, but if you discover any errors or insufficient explanations, please contact [the UMSKT Team](https://umskt.zulipchat.com/).
